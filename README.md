You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Predict spam or ham.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `SmSSpamCollection` dataset file to complete your work.  You will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

```bash
ipython notebook Predict spam or ham.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Predict spam or ham.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
